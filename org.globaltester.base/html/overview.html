<h2>GlobalTester framework overview</h2>

<p>Thank you for using <span class="strong"><strong>GlobalTester</strong></span>.
<span class="strong"><strong>GlobalTester</strong></span> provides a
platform to manage testing and analysis of smart cards and e-passport
applications.</p>

<p><span class="strong"><strong>GlobalTester</strong></span> is
delivered as a set of plug-ins for the popular Eclipse platform and
allows the execution of a set of test scripts structured with XML and
defined using Java Script. It is based on Open Source projects such as <span
	class="strong"><strong>Smart Card Shell</strong></span> and supports
the <span class="strong"><strong>GlobalPlatform</strong></span>
standard.</p>

<p><span class="strong"><strong>GT TestManager</strong></span> can
be used to create and execute individual test suites or in automated
batch processing &ndash; typically required during final acceptance
testing. An intuitive easy-to-use interface improves productivity. A
simple visual &ldquo;pass / fail&rdquo; notification system immediately
indicates where non-conformities have been detected.</p>

<p><span class="strong"><strong>GT TestManager</strong></span> is
the base platform for the application of the test tools of the <span
	class="strong"><strong>GT Prove family</strong></span>. <span
	class="strong"><strong>GT Prove IS</strong></span> allows users to
prove the conformance of e-passport inspection systems, <span
	class="strong"><strong>GT Prove ePP</strong></span> enables
organisations to test e-passports for conformity. Both test tools prove
conformity with the latest test standard. Other <span class="strong"><strong>GT
Prove test suites</strong></span> are planned. Users are welcome to develop their 
own test suites.</p>

<p>Interoperability between e-passports and readers is of paramount
importance. Issuing authorities and passport manufacturers must rely on
solutions which conform to the international standards for e-passports.
ICAO published test specifications for BAC passports, while the German
BSI and the French AFNOR published test specifications for EAC
passports. Together these tests have become the test standards for
worldwide e-passport conformity testing.</p>

<p>The <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove ePP</strong></span>
allows organisations to test e-passports for conformity with the latest
conformity testing standards. With <span class="strong"><strong>GT
Prove ePP</strong></span>, users can prove the conformance of electronic passports
according to ICAO RF Protocol and Application Test Standard for
e-Passports, part 3 and AFNOR/BSI EAC test specifications.</p>

<p><span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove ePP</strong></span> test
software incorporates an ISO 14443 reader simulator device, an EAC
passport API software and a script based test suite. The EAC passport API
together with a test reader device simulates an inspection system and
provides all cryptographic functions to read any e-passport. The test
scripts can be executed in an automatic batch process or individually.</p>

<p><b>GT Prove ePA</b> is a test tool designed for testing EAC 2.0 applications 
on the German electronic ID card. The EAC 2.0 or EACv2 protocol standard 
is a further development of the EAC or EACv1 standard, which is already 
applied to electronic passports worldwide. GT Prove ePA was the first test 
tool for conformance testing of the new electronic ID card in Germany to assure 
error-free functioning and interoperability. the technical guidelines 
BSI TR-03105 Part 3.3 and Part 3.4, issued by the German Federal Office for 
Information Security (BSI), are the basis for the conformity test.</p>

<p><b>GT Prove ePA</b> is comprised of two modules. The ePA conformity test 
software implements the tests on layer 6 (smart card OS) and layer 7 
(application data) in JavaScript form. An EAC 2.0 API simulates the 
EAC 2.0-specific cryptographic functions of a reading device in accordance 
with technical guideline BSI TR-03110. </p>

<p>The <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove IS</strong></span>
enables users to prove the conformance of e-passport inspection systems
with the international standards for electronic passports. Incorporating
the world's first real-time EAC passport simulator, the <span
	class="strong"><strong>GT Prove IS</strong></span> provides users with
a high-performance, reliable and extensible test tool for e-passport
inspection systems worldwide.</p>

<p>With <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove IS</strong></span>,
users can now prove the conformance of inspection systems according to
TR-03105 part 5. This test tool incorporates an ISO 14443 card simulator
device, EAC passport simulator software and a script-based test suite.
The EAC passport simulator works as a unique &ldquo;golden
reference&rdquo;. The test scripts can be executed in an automatic batch
process or individually. The scripting language provides full
transparency to the test engineer and is flexible to be able to add
user-specific test cases quickly.</p>

<p>The <b>GT Prove ePA Reader</b> is a conformity test tool and automation framework 
that has been developed for testing the eID card readers (EAC readers) for the 
German electronic ID card (ePA), which was launched November 1, 2010.<br>
The EAC 2.0 protocol standard used here is a further development of the EAC standard 
that is already in use for e-passports worldwide. The GT Prove ePA Reader was the 
first available test tool for this conformity test. Conformance testing is essential 
to assure error-free functioning and interoperability of the new eID cards and 
related reader infrastructure. The test tool is based on the technical guideline 
TR-03105 Part 5.2 issued by the BSI for testing the conformity of eID cards and 
eSign-compliant eID card reader systems with EAC 2.</p>

<p>The <b>GT Prove ePA Reader</b> consists of three modules. The conformity tests for ePA 
readers are implemented on the application level, layers 6 and 7, in JavaScript form.
 An EAC 2.0 API simulates the EAC 2.0-specific cryptographic functions of an eID 
 card in accordance with BSI TR-03110 and TR-03119.</p>
