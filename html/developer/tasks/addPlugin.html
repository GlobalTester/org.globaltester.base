	<h1>Add a new plugin</h1>
	<p>
		Whenever additional functionality is only optional for GlobalTester
		and can be decoupled from the existing plugins it is a good idea to
		start a new plugin project. You will find some hints when to start a
		new plugin and when to add to an existing one in our <a
			href="concepts/devGuidelines.html">development guidelines</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Create plugin project</h2>
	<p>To create a new plugin project from scratch start the "New
		Project" wizard. Select in Eclipse "Package Explorer" view "New >
		Project" and there use "Plug-in Project" and click "Next".</p>
	<p>
		In the following screens fill in the project name, plugin ID and
		related data. Again you will find several hints regarding the values
		to use here in our <a href="concepts/devGuidelines.html">development
			guidelines</a>.
	</p>
	<p>When the basic plugin structure is created you can start to
		implement the code just as ordinary Eclipse plugin development.
		Remeber to add a second plugin project containing a fragment to your plugin
		which includes all your tests.</p>
	<p>
		For your plugin to be available during execution and buckminster
		provisioning it must be added to a feature that is referenced from the
		buckminster entry point. Add it to the features where your plugin fits
		or <a href="../concepts/addFeature.html">add a new feature</a> if none
		fits.
	</p>
	<h2>Integrate plugin in source control and build processes</h2>
	<p>TODO</p>
	<p>Integration will be handled mostly by buckminster, but for 
		Jenkins / Buckminster to update included plugins they need to be 
		configured in the relevant jenkins builds as used SVN source.</p>
