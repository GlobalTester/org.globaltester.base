	<h1>Setup Gerrit Account</h1>
	<p>
		When you received your credentials to the review server you will need
		to configure your account on gerrit before you can use it to fetch
		code or review commits. </a>.
	</p>
	<p>After your first login you will be presented with a page where
		you need to enter your full name and verify your eMail-Address. Make
		sure that these are the same values as those you use in your
		development environment as gerrit checks them on every commit you
		push.</p>
	<p>To be able to access the repository via SSH you need to provide
		the public keys of the key pairs you want to use. Select "Settings" >
		"SSH Public Keys" and paste your SSH key in the presented window.</p>
