	<h1>Add a new Test Fragment</h1>
	<p>
		After you created a new plug-in to implement new functionality within
		GlobalTester you most certainly want to implement a test fragment
		also. As detailed in our <a href="concepts/devGuidelines.html">development
			guidelines</a> a test fragment (e.g. for JUnit tests) is required for most plug-ins that exists in
		GlobalTester repository.
	</p>

	<h2>Create test fragment and code</h2>
	<p>To create a new fragment project from scratch start the "New
		Project" wizard. Select in Eclipse "Package Explorer" view "New >
		Project > Plug-in Development" and there use "Fragment Project" and click "Next".</p>
	<p>
		Now fill in the project name, fragment ID, related data and the
		required host plug-in. Again you will find several hints regarding the
		values to use here in our <a href="../concepts/devGuidelines.html">development
			guidelines</a>.
	</p>
	<p>When the basic fragment structure is created you can start to
		implement the code and testcases. CI builds on Jenkins require tests
		to be implemented as JUnit-Tests optionally using SWTBot for
		GUI-Testing. You can define as much test cases and test suites as you
		want. For integration in CI builds you should define at least two
		suites; one full test suite containing all available tests and one
		smoke test suite that contains only a minimal set of tests to verify
		overall functionality.</p>
	<p>For your fragment code to be available during execution and
		buckminster provisioning the fragment it must be added to a test feature
		that is referenced from the buckminster entry point.</p>

	<h2>Configure required launch configurations</h2>
	TODO
	<p>at least full and smoke</p>
	<p>launch configs in project under version control</p>
	<p>fragmentname.[full/smoke].launch</p>
	<p>all available workspace and taragetplatform plug-ins</p>
	<p></p>

	<h2>Add launch configurations to buckminster scripts and integrate
		projects in CI</h2>
	<p>
		Currently the scripts executed during the CI-Builds on Jenkins are
		still maintained manually. They are located in
		<code>com.hjp.globaltester.releng</code> in <code> globaltester_rcp.headless</code>
		and you need to add lines like the following to them (somewhere after
		the build command):
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>junit -l
			org.globaltester.core.test/org.globaltester.core.test.full.launch
			--flatXML -o junit/org.globaltester.core.xml</code>
	</p>
	<p>After the fragment is referenced from a feature used by
		buckminster it will be materialized in the corresponding CI-workspaces
		autmatically. In order to rebuild CI-Projects also on changes in the
		test fragments these fragments need to be referenced from the
		CI-Projects configuration. This step is similar for fragments as for
		plug-ins and is described in <a href="addPlugin.html">"Add a new plug-in"</a>.</p>
	<p>Sometime in the future we plan to replace those scripts by
		automatically generated ones so that this step will become needless.</p>
