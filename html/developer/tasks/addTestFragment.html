	<h1>Add a new test fragment</h1>
	<p>
		After you created a new plugin to implement new functionality within
		GlobalTester you most certainly want to implement a test fragment
		also. As detailed in our <a href="concepts/devGuidelines.html">development
			guidelines</a> a test fragment is required for each plugin that exists in
		GlobalTester repository.
	</p>

	<h2>Create test fragment</h2>

	<h2>Configure required launch configurations</h2>

	<h2>Add launch configurations to buckminster scripts</h2>
	<p>
		Currently the scripts executed during the CI-Builds on Jenkins are
		still maintained manually. They are located in
		<code>com.hjp.globaltester.releng</code>
		and you need to add lines like the following to them (somewhere after the build command):
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>junit -l
			org.globaltester.core.test/org.globaltester.core.test.full.launch
			--flatXML -o junit/org.globaltester.core.xml</code>
	</p>
	<p>Sometime in the future we plan to replace those scripts by
		automatically generated ones so that this step will become needless.</p>
