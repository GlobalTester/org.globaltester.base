	<h1>Get the code</h1>
	<p>All required source code is held in the central GlobalTester
		Subversion repository. Access to this repository is controlled by HJP
		Consulting and you may get an account by sending a request via eMail
		to support@hjp-consulting.com.</p>
	<p>The central repository currently can be accessed using the following URL 
	<a href="http://subversion/repo/globaltester">http://subversion/repo/globaltester</a>. 
		This can currently only be accesed from within the HJP private network a 
		public access for this is planned and will be listed here when available.</p>
	<p>After you have configured your access to the server (using your
		credentials) you will see a wide variety of plugin/feature projects.
		Each of them represents a small part of the available GlobalTester
		functionality. But don't be afraid you won't need to handle this
		complexity manually.</p>
	<p>Just checkout the project com.hjp.globaltester.releng to your
		workspace. This is the main release engineering project and it defines
		several Buckminster CQUERYs and MSPECs that can be used to populate
		your workspace with all you need (almost) automatically. To populate
		your workspace with the components you need select the according
		CQUERY or MSPEC, right-click it, and select "Buckminster > Import...".
		This will fire up a wizard that guides you through the process.</p>
	<p>Below you will find a list of interesting Buckminster targets
		and what they are used for. Depending on your subscription you might
		not be able to import all of them (although you can see the
		Buckminster definitions). Please make sure that the first target you
		materialize is the target platform. This ensures that you develop
		against the correct target definition and makes sure that no
		non-GlobalTester components get materialized inside your workspace
		instead of inside the targetplatform.</p>
