    <p> Thank you for using <span class="strong"><strong>GlobalTester</strong></span>. <span class="strong"><strong>GlobalTester</strong></span> provides a platform to manage testing and analysis
        of smart cards and e-passport applications.</p>

    <p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>GlobalTester</strong></span> is delivered as a set of plug-ins for the
        popular Eclipse platform and allows the execution of a set of test scripts structured with
        XML and defined using Java Script. It is based on Open Source projects such as <span class="strong"><strong>Smart Card Shell</strong></span> and supports the <span class="strong"><strong>GlobalPlatform</strong></span> standard.</p>

    <p><span class="strong"><strong>GT TestManager</strong></span> can be used to create and execute
        individual test suites or in automated batch processing &ndash; typically required during final
        acceptance testing. An intuitive easy-to-use interface improves productivity. A simple
        visual &ldquo;pass / fail&rdquo; notification system immediately indicates where non-conformities have
        been detected.</p>

    <p><span class="strong"><strong>GT TestManager</strong></span> is the base platform for the application
        of the test tools of the <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove family</strong></span>. <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove IS</strong></span> allows users to prove the conformance of e-passport
        inspection systems, <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove ePP</strong></span> enables organisations to
        test e-passports for conformity. Both test tools prove conformity with the latest test
        standard. Other <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove test suites</strong></span> are planned. Users
        are welcome to develop their own test suites. </p>

    <p> Interoperability between e-passports and readers is of paramount importance. Issuing
        authorities and passport manufacturers must rely on solutions which conform to the
        international standards for e-passports. ICAO published test specifications for BAC
        passports, while the German BSI and the French AFNOR published test specifications for EAC
        passports. Together these tests have become the test standards for worldwide e-passport
        conformity testing.</p>


    <p>The <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove ePP</strong></span> allows organisations to test
        e-passports for conformity with the latest conformity testing standards. With <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove ePP</strong></span>, users can prove the conformance of electronic
        passports according to ICAO RF Protocol and Application Test Standard for e-Passports, part
        3 and AFNOR/BSI EAC test specifications.</p>

    <p><span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove ePP</strong></span> test software incorporates an ISO 14443
        reader simulator device, an EAC passport API software and a scriptbased test suite. The EAC
        passport API together with a test reader device simulates an inspection system and provides
        all cryptographic functions to read any e-passport. The test scripts can be executed in an
        automatic batch process or individually.</p>

    <p>The <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove IS</strong></span> enables users to prove the conformance
        of e-passport inspection systems with the international standards for electronic passports.
        Incorporating the world's first real-time EAC passport simulator, the <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove IS</strong></span> provides users with a high-performance, reliable
        and extensible test tool for e-passport inspection systems worldwide.</p>
    <p> With <span class="strong"><strong>GT Prove IS</strong></span>, users can now prove the conformance
        of inspection systems according to TR-03105 part 5. This test tool incorporates an ISO 14443
        card simulator device, EAC passport simulator software and a script-based test suite. The
        EAC passport simulator works as a unique &ldquo;golden reference&rdquo;. The test scripts can be
        executed in an automatic batch process or individually. The scripting language provides full
        transparency to the test engineer and is flexible to be able to add user-specific test cases
        quickly.</p>
