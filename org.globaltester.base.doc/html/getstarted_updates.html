<h2>Updating GlobalTester Plug-ins</h2>

    <p>Updates to <span class="strong"><strong>GlobalTester</strong></span> are installed by using the same
        mechanism as described for the installation. When you need to do an offline installation you
        will also need to do an offline update. This means you will need to check regularly for
        updates and overwrite your local update site with the new data. After updating your local
        update site you will be able to do the update using the same process as when using an online
        update site.</p>

    <p>If you where able to use the preferred installation via the online update site you can do
        the update just as easy as well. Also you will be able to configure automatic updates so
        that Eclipse will check for new versions and inform you so you can install them.</p>
