<h2>Installing GlobalTester Plug-ins manually</h2>

<p>If you want to install GT Plug-ins to an existing workspace, e.g. if you are already using a GT deploy bundle and acquired an additional plug-in, you can install the plug-ins manually.</p>

<p>For&nbsp;manual installation of <span class="strong"><strong>Global Tester framework</strong></span> you can download a ZIP-file containing a copy of the update site from <a class="link" href="http://www.globaltester.org" target="_top">http://www.globaltester.org</a><span> or (depending on your subscription) from&nbsp;</span>our download site&nbsp;(remember to Login or the downloads are hidden). This ZIP-file includes all files that are present on the update site together with the needed meta files to create a local update site.</p>

<p>To install plug-ins from the ZIP-file simply unpack the whole archive into a location in your local filesystem and select this location as update site during the installation process as described in <a class="xref" href="install_gt.html" title="Installing GlobalTester Plug-ins">the section called &ldquo;Installing GlobalTester Plug-ins&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>When updates to your purchased products become available new update site images will be provided which you can unpack in the same location in your filesystem and overwrite old files.</p>
