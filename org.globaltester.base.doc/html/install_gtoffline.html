<h2>Installing GlobalTester Plug-ins offline</h2>
    

    <p>If you are not able to use the automatic installation procedure, e.g. because you do not
        have an internet connection available on your machine, you can install the plug-ins
        manually. In this case the automatic update process will not work as no online update site
        is available.</p>

    <p>For offline installation of <span class="strong"><strong>Global Tester framework</strong></span> you can
        download a ZIP-file containing a copy of the update site from <a class="link" href="http://www.globaltester.org" target="_top">http://www.globaltester.org</a><span> or (depending on your
        subscription) from </span>
        <a class="link" href="https://www.hjp-consulting.com/downloads" target="_top">https://www.hjp-consulting.com/downloads</a> (remember to Login or the downloads are hidden). This ZIP-file includes all files that are
        present on the update site together with the needed meta files to create a local update
        site.</p>

    <p>To install plug-ins form the ZIP-file simply unpack the whole archive into a location in
        your local filesystem and select this location as update site during the installation
        process as described in <a class="xref" href="install_gt.html" title="Installing GlobalTester Plug-ins">the section called &ldquo;Installing GlobalTester Plug-ins&rdquo;</a>.</p>

    <p>When updates to your purchased products become available new update site images will be
        provided which you can unpack in the same location in your filesystem and overwrite old
        files. Then again you can perform the update as if your update site was an online
        one.</p>
