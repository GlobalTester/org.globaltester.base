<h2>Installing Eclipse</h2>
    
    <p><span class="strong"><strong>GlobalTester</strong></span> framework consists of different Eclipse
        plug-ins and requires the <span class="strong"><strong>Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</strong></span>
        Version 3.6 or higher. Eclipse can be downloaded from <a class="link" href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_top">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>.</p>
    <p>To install Eclipse, all you need to do is unpack the zip file downloaded in the desired
        directory. No further work is required (other than making sure you have a Java Runtime
        Environment installed). When you unzip the file, it creates a directory called "eclipse",
        with multiple subdirectories below that. For example, you could unpack the zip file in the
        root directory (e.g., C:\) and Eclipse would be installed in C:\eclipse.</p>

        <p>The location where Eclipse is installed must be writable for all users who will run
            GlobalTester. So it is recommended <span class="strong"><strong>not</strong></span> to install it
            under "C:/Program files" as this location gets virtualized since Windows Vista.</p>

        <p>Installing Eclipse does not change the Windows registry. Please use a third-party
           unzip program to unpack the Eclipse zip file, such as Winzip, FileZip, or EasyZip.
